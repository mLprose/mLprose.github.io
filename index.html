                <p class="paragraph">Geology, a branch of Earth science, delves into the intricate study of the Earth's composition, structure, and processes that have shaped its surface over millennia. Geologists analyze rocks, minerals, and fossils to unravel the planet's geological history, deciphering the stories written in the layers beneath our feet. This field not only aids in understanding past environmental changes but also plays a crucial role in predicting and mitigating natural hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Geology's interdisciplinary nature connects it to other scientific disciplines, contributing to our broader comprehension of the Earth's dynamic and ever-evolving nature.</p>
